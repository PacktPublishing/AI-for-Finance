## About the Video Course
A lot of solutions to key problems in financial world require predicting the future patterns in data from the past to make better financial decisions right now. The evolution of modern machine learning methods and tools in recent years in the field of computer vision  bring promise of the same progress in other important fields like financial forecasting.

In this course you will first learn how to quickly get started with ML in finances by predicting the future currency exchange rates using a simple modern machine learning method. In this example you will learn how to choose the basic data preparation method and model and then how to improve them. In the next module you will discover a variety of ways to prepare data and then how they influence models training accuracy. In the last module you will learn how to find and test a few key modern machine learning models to pick up the best performing one.

After finishing this course you will have a solid introduction to apply ML methods to financial data forecasting.
